          Seneca College computer programming & analysis graduate of 2015. Studied mixology and wine council studies before that.
          Dabbled in audio engineering and production before that. Guitar player for nigh on 12 years now, and a big believer
          in the harmony between opposite schools of knowledge and experience. The project overviews below highlight my humble contributions
          to a few different use cases. If there are two things I've learned about the development process so far, it's that
          it could be as personal and unique as songwriting, and that passion is <i>very</i>&nbsp; contagious.

              <h5>Wellpad Survey/Follow-up Platform</h5>
              <p>
                This iPad-centric solution was commissioned in order to ameliorate an older system used for managing a health clinic's
                patient and staff data. It provides an intuitive survey platform, as well as an administrative interface for viewing current information and trends
                in both new and returning patients.
                My primary role throughout the duration of this project was to implement front-end views and components for the patient-intake and follow-up survey slides.
                Graphic design mock-ups of every view and component were issued out by team lead <a href="https://twitter.com/lee_saynor" target="_blank">Lee Saynor</a>, and I was to try and bring them to life and make them usable the best of my ability.
                Lead Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/tabakd_" target="_blank">Daniel Tabak</a> maintained a unique and frenetic pace throughout every milestone.

                The tech stack was and largely still is on the bleeding edge of web development today -
                ES6 React paired with Redux and styled with the Materialize CSS framework alongside Swiper providing cohesion and kinetics for the whole show (the latter 2 coincidentally being used on this very website).
                On the back-end, everything sat on top Node.js with data models being managed by MongoDB and Mongoose.js.
